Typetta is an **open-source ORM** usable on Node JS, Browser, Cordova, PhoneGap, Ionic, React Native, NativeScript, Expo and Electron platforms. It is written entirely in TypeScript language and its goal is to provide advanced and fully typed access to all **main SQL databases** (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, SQLLite3, CockroachDB, MariaDB, Oracle and Amazon Redshift) and the NoSQL **MongoDB** database.

Typetta can be used in any TypeScript backend (including serverless applications and microservices), but our advice is to use it when developing **GraphQL** backends, because we love GraphQL.

# How does it work?

You can find all the useful information, guides and tutorials on how to best use Typetta on the [official documentation](https://twinlogix.github.io/typetta/).
